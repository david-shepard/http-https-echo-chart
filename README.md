# http-https-echo-chart ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

This helm chart deploys the [`http-https-echo`](https://github.com/mendhak/docker-http-https-echo) docker image to a kubernetes environment.

Kudos to [`mendhak`](https://github.com/mendhak) ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` located in `<chart-directory>`:

```bash
helm install --name my-release <chart-directory>
```

This command deploys the chart with sane defaults.

A k8s service will be created with a ClusterIP configuration exposing two ports:
 * 8080 -> HTTP
 * 8443 -> HTTPs


## Verifying the Chart

See NOTES.txt associated with this chart for verification instructions

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
helm delete my-release --purge
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
